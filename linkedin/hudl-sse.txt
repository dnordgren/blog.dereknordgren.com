As a full-stack software engineer, I worked on:

- AWS - S3, some EC2, RDS, SNS, SQS, Kinesis and more
- .NET (Core) in Docker running in AWS ECS
- React (TypeScript), Redux
- GraphQL
- MongoDB (DocumentDB), SQL (RDS - MSSQL and Postgres)
- Elasticsearch, Elasticache (Redis), RabbitMQ

I also have some experience with React Native development on iOS.

A couple of my favorite projects at Hudl as a senior software engineer:

User activity tracking and reporting platform. Backed by an AWS-powered big-data processing pipeline capable of handling 6 billion events per month.
- iOS, Android and web clients instrumented with modules to track user activity on the Hudl platform
- Tracking events validated via a Snowplow Analytics structured events schema (backed by AWS Kinesis); events aggregated into reportable format via AWS S3 and Glue ETL jobs
- Persistence via AWS Aurora Postgres SQL database
- Reporting data exposed via GraphQL API backed by .NET Core web application containerized in Docker running in AWS ECS
- Visualizations via React 16 single-page web app, built in TypeScript.

System rearchitecture of Hudl's video and data models.
- Eliminate a legacy system integral to Hudl's video upload pipeline
- Utilize advanced architecture patterns and migration techniques to safely migrate backend systems without downtime
- Decoupling critical systems via message-based architecture powered by Amazon SQS and SNS
