I currently lead Hudl's Cloud Infrastructure team, which is responsible for building and maintaining the AWS infrastructure that powers Hudl.com.

Hudl's a cloud-native company. We're using infra-as-code (Terraform, Packer, Chef), containers (ECS, migrating to EKS) and other automation (Lambdas, Python, AWS Systems Manager) to empower our development teams to move fast and build great products on top of the latest and greatest from AWS.

My team also works closely with our Security Engineers to manage IAM access to our numerous AWS accounts, provision new accounts with appropriate "guardrails" and monitor activity through CloudTrail, Control Tower, CrowdStrike and other products.

## My background is in software engineering

Before infrastructure, I was a senior full-stack software engineer at Hudl. I design, build and maintain highly performant and scalable software solutions that help Hudl's coaches and athletes unlock peak performance. Full-stack microservice development at Hudl often includes:
- AWS - S3, some EC2, RDS, SNS, SQS, Kinesis and more
- .NET (Core) in Docker running in AWS ECS
- React (TypeScript), Redux
- GraphQL
- MongoDB (DocumentDB), SQL (RDS - MSSQL and Postgres)
- Elasticsearch, Elasticache (Redis), RabbitMQ

Beyond my role as a software engineer, I pride myself on being a "product" generalist. I'm energized by working with great, cross-functional teams to solve business and engineering challenges. I'm passionate about driving continuous improvement and bringing great products to market at high velocity with low risk.

I also led dev ops for Hudl's platform team. I managed the dev ops efforts for several engineering teams to ensure Hudl's systems maintain high levels of availability, reliability and durability for our most demanding customers.

## Before Hudl, I co-founded CRG.

I was the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of a small start-up, Concise Research Group ("CRG"). I led our product team in designing and building web-based surveying and reporting tools that help law enforcement departments build better relationships with the communities they serve.

Our products applied the latest best practices in procedural justice research to enable law enforcements leaders to make data-driven process changes that save money, reduce use of force incidents and save civilian and officer lives. Our products were used by multiple law enforcement departments across the U.S.
