          I currently lead Hudl's Cloud Infrastructure team, which is

          Hudl's a cloud-native company. We're using infra-as-code (Terraform,
          Packer), containers (ECS now - k8s soon) and other automation
          (Lambdas, Python, Chef) to empower our development teams to move fast
          and build great products on top of the latest and greatest from AWS.

        <p>
          Before infrastructure, I was a senior full-stack software engineer. I
          enjoy designing software architectures and products for scalability
          and performance. My preferred stack involves Docker-ized .NET Core
          running on AWS, React written in TypeScript, GraphQL and MongoDB. That

          and love learning new things.

        <p>
          I pride myself on being a "product" generalist. I'm energized by
          working with great, cross-functional teams to solve business and
          engineering challenges. I'm passionate about driving continuous
          improvement and bringing great products to market at high velocity
          with low risk.

          I was the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of a small start-up,
          Concise Research Group (CRG). I led our product team in designing and
          building web-based surveying and reporting tools which helped law
          enforcement departments build better relationships with the
          communities they serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our products applied the latest best practices in procedural justice
          research to enable law enforcements leaders to make data-driven
          process changes that save money, reduce use of force incidents and{' '}
          <strong>save civilian and officer lives</strong>. Our products were
          used by multiple law enforcement departments across the U.S.
